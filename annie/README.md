# Annie

Annie is a set of programmable robotics hardware, its associated software library, and a collection of curricula designed to introduce students to robotics.
The lessons are primarily targeted toward secondary school students, ages 12 and up, who has never had exposure to electronics and computer programming.

## Goals

We have a set of goals that we think should guide the development and implementation of the curricula:

### We Aim to Inspire
The primary goal of the curricula is to familiarize and inspire the students to learn more about general science and technology (aka STEM).
As a corollary, our goal is not to teach the students the specifics of the particular hardware we have chosen, nor to be a
manual for an arbitrary development libraries and environments that we use. 

### Ease of Implementation
Often, the barrier to quality education is a lack of resources. Our goal is to make the curricula as easy to realize as we can,
both in terms of the ease of teaching them and the affordability of implementing them. 

### An Open Platform
We understand that different situations call for different approaches. We aim to keep the curricula flexible, both in terms 
of the hardware and software requirements, and the lesson plans.

### Community Driven
We fully encourage and embrace input from all stake holders, especially the instructors on the ground and the students participating.

## Hardware Specifications
The current version consists of a motorized car and a couple of sensors used to allow the robot to react to its surroundings.
See more details [here](hardware/).

## Software Library
The current version of the Arduino IDE based library provides abstractions over the Arduino hardware so that participants are not distracted by the 
details of the hardware, such as the pin layout, voltage control, and etc.
See more details [here](library/arduino/).
