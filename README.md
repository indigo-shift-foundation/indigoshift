# indigoshift

This is the general repository for the lesson curricula and other stuff made by Indigo Shift Foundation.

Indigo Shift Foundation runs various after school classrooms and one-off events that aim to inspire the younger generation to pursue interests in STEM.
We have run robotics and general technology classes in the NYC area, making use of low-cost, off the shelf hardware combined with
software that we developed for each of our curricula.

Our goal with this repository is to share our methodologies and technology that we have accumulated over the years,
hopeful that we can contribute back to the education community and improve our curricula based on the input from 
experienced educators at large.


# Annie

Annie is a robotics program that we developed for middle school after school programs in New York City.
It is a combination of self-assembled low-cost robotic hardware, a software library to abstract the details of the 
hardware to make controlling it easy, and a set of lesson plans that guide the educator through a series of exercises
that that introduce the basic principles of robotics to the students.

The goal of the program is not to overburden the students with the details of the specific pieces of hardware that we chose to use.
Rather, the aim is to introduce to the students the basic concepts required to build self-controlled robots, such as the 
basics of motor control (the output), sensors (the input), and the logic between them that map given inputs to specific and useful outputs.

This program is named after one of the coolest, but often overlooked, astronomer in the Universe, [Annie Jump Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon).
She was a pioneer of contemporary stellar classification, and paved the way for (still incomplete) equality in academic fields 
for people of all backgrounds.
